xvim was originally created in late 2015 at World Online, the Web github.
In Faurecia in ShangHai, China.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made xvim that much better:

    CHENG Canux <canuxcheng@gmail.com>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    Thanks Faurecia (China) Holding Co., Ltd. for the platform.

    And thanks colleagues for code review and test the project and feedback bugs.
